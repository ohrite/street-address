Dear Chicago Card Plus customer, 

This notice is to let you know that your Chicago Card Plus will expire on 03/31/2011. Every Chicago Card Plus has an expiration date approximately four years from the date of issuance and must be renewed before its expiration.

CTA will replace your expiring Chicago Card Plus card at no cost to you. To make sure we're sending your card to the right place, we'll need to confirm your current mailing address (this helps to protect the security of your account).

Card Number: 000868084 
Ron Ronson
1219 W Byron St. #1R 
Chicago, IL 60613

If this is not your correct address, click here to update your information. 

Remember: We cannot send you a replacement card until we have received confirmation of your address. Once we have received confirmation of your address, your new card will be sent as quickly as possible.

If you do not confirm your address at least 10 business days before your card expires, you might not receive your new card before the old one expires (and be temporarily without the ability to use Chicago Card Plus).

You should receive your new card within 10 business days of confirmation and can begin using it right away. Since your account balance is stored in an online account, there is no need to transfer balances - just start using the new card when you receive it and destroy the old one. If you do not receive your replacement card within 10 business days of confirmation, please contact Customer Service by calling 1-888-YOUR-CTA (1-888-CTA-TTY1), Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. 

Thank you for using your Chicago Card Plus!
